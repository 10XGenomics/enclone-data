This directory contains files from Wang et al. 2021 Nature Communications,
"Single-cell RNA sequencing of peripheral blood mononuclear cells from acute
Kawasaki disease patients." The DOI for the paper is 10.1038/s41467-021-25771-5.

While information for up to 9 humans was deposited in GSE168732 (GEO deposition,
full link https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE168732), only 7
humans' data was submitted in a form that could be replicated/reconstructed. The
files we downloaded from GEO were `filtered_contig_annotations.csv` and
`filtered_contig.fasta`. Information about the donors can be found in the paper
though a short summary of the samples is provided below.

From these files we created files all_contig_annotations.json, using a program
json_from_filtered that is in the enclone repo as enclone_tools/src/bin/json_from_filtered.rs.

Note that the resulting all_contig_annotations.json files do not include annotation information,
so to use them with enclone, one either needs to specify BUILT_IN or else REF=... RE.

Kawasaki disease donors:

* healthy (control) donors, named here normal1, normal2, normal3
* patients (1,4,5,6)
  - before IVIG therapy
  - after IVIG therapy.
