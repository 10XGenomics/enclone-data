Cases of 10X Genomics barcodes with two or more consensus heavy chain sequences for which more than ten UMI were detected were generally flagged as potential doublets for removal from scRNA-seq analysis. Similarly, cases where no clear heavy chains could be attributed (none above 10 UMIs) were also flagged for removal. Two exceptions were made: 1\/ in cases of identical CDR3s but differing isotypes (c_call), in which case the isotype switched sequence was kept and UMI counts from both contigs were aggregated; and 2\/ in cases when one the heavy chains was clearly over represented at the UMI level and the second most represented sequences did not exceed ten UMIs, in which case the most represented sequence was kept.\n\nProcessing by iReceptor: Removed \" \" and NAs with AIRR_df.replace('\"', '') and AIRR_df.replace(\"NA\",\"\")",
